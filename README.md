# Challenge Summary
Using map to find target number in an array using Java.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created a function that take an array and a target key. Assign start and end point index. Set up middle point. Check if target is greater and assign start point one less than middle point. If target is less than target last point is one index less than middle point. If middle equal than target return index. If item is not there return -1.
