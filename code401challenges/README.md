# Reverse an Array
For this Code Challenge my partner and I decide to create an empty array to input the reverse array

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The challenge was to implemented into Java. Java is a new language for me. I found out that Java is more specific and in order to add a new item into a new array it has to be by using the index location of the new array and the new value.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
We decide to use a loop. Because it was the most familiar way to do reverse. Time complexity is O(n^2).
